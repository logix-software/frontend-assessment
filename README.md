# Vue/Tailwind Skills Assessment

Welcome to Logix Software! This exercise is designed to evaluate your experience with Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript by developing this prototype. This project utilizes Nuxt.js, and you can find its documentation [here](https://nuxt.com/).

Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
Start the development server with `npm run dev`.

# Instructions for Developing the Prototype

## 1. Repository Setup
Start by forking this repository

## 2. Prototype Overview
You will be developing a prototype based on the design found at Figma ([View Design](https://www.figma.com/file/w029yGy9JL93kzmv15NzX4/padel-dao?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=iWOS1srC4Nyqe9E2-1)). Aim to achieve a balance between quality and quantity within an 8-hour workday. Focus on demonstrating what can be accomplished in this timeframe rather than completing the entire design.

## 3. Prototype Details
- **Pages**: The prototype consists of two main pages: Home and Contacts. The Roadmap is a modal, not a page. The Cookie Bar is an element showing how the cookie banner should appear across all pages.
- **Interactive Elements**: For the Roadmap interaction, select frame A.1.1 - Roadmap (View on Figma) and click 'Play' at the top-right corner to understand its functionality. (If you encounter any issues, let me know for assistance).

## 4. Contact Page
The contact form should be static. Focus on storing all filled data in an object named `formContact`.

## 5. Assets Exportation
Images and SVGs can be exported from Figma by selecting the desired item and using the 'Export' button found in the bottom-right sidebar.

## 6. Element Selection on Figma
To accurately select elements, you may need to click multiple times to ensure proper selection, then export or view the CSS specifications from the right sidebar. (If you encounter any issues, let me know for assistance)

## 7. Fonts
Fonts can be sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Import them directly from this site without downloading the files.

## 8. Mobile Design
There is no specific mobile design provided. Feel free to design this aspect as you see fit.

## 9. Interactive Slider
The section titled "DOVE SIAMO PRESENTI" features a slider with left and right arrows that allow scrolling through a list.

## 10. Component Reusability
Evaluate elements that are repeated throughout the design and create components with their variants to optimize reusability.

## 11. TailwindCSS Adjustments
If some elements have dimensions that differ slightly from the standard sizes in TailwindCSS, feel free to use the closest TailwindCSS classes. Do not create custom or inline classes for minor pixel differences.

## 12. Completion and Review
Once you have completed your tasks, create a pull request for the branch you developed on. This will allow for a review of the changes you have made.
